# The Rest of US

**Connecting senior global tech talent directly with recruiters — bypassing ATS filters and regional bias.**

🌍 **Live site:** https://the-rest-of-us.github.io

The Rest of US is an open-source, decentralized directory of senior tech talent based outside the United States. Experienced engineers, architects and technical leaders in the UK, Canada, Latin America, Asia-Pacific and beyond are routinely screened out by keyword-matching ATS tools, location checks and age proxies such as graduation years, before a human reads their CV.

This project takes a different approach:

- **Impact, not chronology.** Profiles describe systems built and outcomes delivered. The [schema](profiles/schema.json) has no fields for birth dates, graduation years, employment dates or "years of experience", and rejects any field it doesn't define.
- **Peer vouches in public.** Colleagues vouch for each other through pull requests from their own GitHub accounts, so every endorsement has a traceable author.
- **No middleman.** Recruiters contact candidates directly. No accounts, no fees, no tracking.
- **Federated.** Regional hubs are independent GitHub repositories run by their own maintainers. This site is just a search UI over their public JSON feeds.
- **Static.** Everything runs on GitHub Pages. No backend, no database.

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`index.html`](index.html) | The single-page search UI: Tailwind CSS, Fuse.js and vanilla JavaScript, all loaded from CDNs. |
| [`hubs.json`](hubs.json) | Registry of regional hubs and their feed URLs. |
| [`profiles/schema.json`](profiles/schema.json) | JSON Schema (draft 2020-12) that every candidate profile must pass. |
| [`profiles/demo.json`](profiles/demo.json) | Fictional sample profiles so the UI works before any hub goes live. They are labelled "Sample" in the UI. |

## For candidates

You publish your profile by opening a pull request against the hub for your region. You never need to touch this repository.

1. **Find your hub** in [`hubs.json`](hubs.json) or under [Hubs & feeds](https://the-rest-of-us.github.io/#hubs) on the site. If your region has no hub yet, see [Launching a regional hub](#launching-a-regional-hub).
2. **Fork the hub repository** and create `profiles/<your-github-handle>.json`. Start from one of the entries in [`profiles/demo.json`](profiles/demo.json).
3. **Write about impact.** Fill in `major_impact` with the systems you designed and what changed because of them: scale, latency, cost, reliability, team growth. Leave out dates; the schema rejects them.
4. **Validate locally** (optional; CI does this too):
   ```bash
   npx -p ajv-cli -p ajv-formats ajv validate --spec=draft2020 -c ajv-formats \
     -s https://the-rest-of-us.github.io/profiles/schema.json \
     -d profiles/<your-github-handle>.json
   ```
5. **Open a pull request** from your own GitHub account. Maintainers check that the PR author matches the `github` field in your profile, then merge it. Your profile shows up on the site the next time the hub's feed is rebuilt, usually within a few minutes.

To **update** your profile, open another PR. To **remove** it, open a PR that deletes the file, or ask a hub maintainer in an issue.

> **Privacy:** everything in your profile is public and can be copied by anyone. Only include contact details you're comfortable publishing. A LinkedIn URL or booking link is a good alternative to an email address.

### Peer vouches

A vouch is a short, signed statement from someone who worked with you.

1. The **voucher**, not the candidate, forks the hub and adds an entry to your profile's `vouches` array:
   ```json
   {
     "vouched_by": "Priya Shah",
     "vouched_by_github": "priyashah",
     "relationship": "peer",
     "statement": "Led the ledger migration I worked on; the most careful engineer I've shipped with.",
     "date": "2026-10-14"
   }
   ```
2. They open the PR **from their own GitHub account**. Maintainers merge only if the PR author matches `vouched_by_github`.
3. After merge, a maintainer (or the hub's CI) sets `verification_url` to the merged PR, which shows up as a **Verify →** link on the profile.

Valid relationships are `manager`, `direct_report`, `peer`, `tech_lead`, `client`, `open_source_collaborator` and `mentor`.

## Launching a regional hub

Anyone can start a hub for a region that doesn't have one, or a region-specific community (a country, or a city).

1. **Create the repo from the template.** Go to [`the-rest-of-us/hub-template`](https://github.com/the-rest-of-us/hub-template) and click **Use this template**. Name it `hub-<region>` (for example `hub-nordics`). Ideally create it inside the `the-rest-of-us` organization; ask in an issue to be added. A hub in your own account works too.
2. **Enable GitHub Pages:** go to *Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: GitHub Actions*.
3. **Check the workflows.** The template ships two:
   - `validate.yml` runs on every PR. It validates each `profiles/*.json` against the central schema, checks that the file name matches `id`, and checks that the PR author matches the profile's `github` handle (or the `vouched_by_github` of any added vouch).
   - `publish.yml` runs on every push to `main`. It merges all profiles into a single `profiles.json` and deploys it to Pages.
4. **Add maintainers.** Put at least two people in `CODEOWNERS` so reviews aren't blocked on one person.
5. **Register the hub.** Open a PR against this repository adding an entry to [`hubs.json`](hubs.json):
   ```json
   {
     "id": "nordics",
     "name": "Nordics",
     "region": "europe",
     "description": "Senior tech talent in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden.",
     "repository": "https://github.com/the-rest-of-us/hub-nordics",
     "profiles_url": "https://the-rest-of-us.github.io/hub-nordics/profiles.json",
     "timezones": ["UTC+1", "UTC+2"],
     "status": "active"
   }
   ```

### Feed format

The UI accepts any of these at `profiles_url`:

- an array of profile objects (recommended, and what the template generates);
- an object with a `profiles` array: `{ "profiles": [ … ] }`;
- an array of relative URLs to individual profile files: `["profiles/ada.json", …]`.

Feeds must be served with CORS enabled. GitHub Pages and `raw.githubusercontent.com` both do this by default. If a hub is unreachable, the UI shows it as *offline* and keeps showing results from the other hubs.

Hub `status` is one of `active`, `demo` (results labelled as samples) or `disabled` (skipped).

## For recruiters

### Use the website

Go to **https://the-rest-of-us.github.io** and:

- search across skills, systems, roles and locations (fuzzy matching, so `kafka` finds `event streaming with Kafka`);
- filter by **skill tags**, **timezone range** (with Americas / EMEA / APAC overlap presets), **work preference** (B2B contract, full-time via EOR, …), **seniority** and **peer-vouched** status;
- click **Contact** to reach the candidate directly by email, booking link or LinkedIn;
- click **JSON** on a card to download that profile, or **Export CSV / JSON** to save your filtered shortlist;
- click **Copy search link** to share a search. All filters are stored in the URL.

### Query the raw feeds

Every hub is plain JSON over HTTPS. No API key, no rate-limited API.

```bash
# List all hub feeds
curl -s https://the-rest-of-us.github.io/hubs.json | jq -r '.hubs[].profiles_url'

# Staff+ engineers in LATAM open to B2B contracts who know Kubernetes
curl -s https://the-rest-of-us.github.io/hub-latam/profiles.json | jq '
  .[] | select(
    (.seniority | IN("staff","principal","distinguished")) and
    (.work_preferences | index("contract_b2b")) and
    (.core_competencies | index("kubernetes"))
  ) | {name, headline, timezone, contact}'
```

```js
// Pull every profile from every hub (Node 18+ or a browser)
const base = 'https://the-rest-of-us.github.io/';
const { hubs } = await (await fetch(base + 'hubs.json')).json();
const results = await Promise.allSettled(
  hubs.filter(h => h.status === 'active')
      .map(h => fetch(new URL(h.profiles_url, base)).then(r => r.json()))
);
const profiles = results.flatMap(r => r.status === 'fulfilled' ? r.value : []);
```

Please be a good citizen: contact people about roles that match their stated preferences, and don't resell or bulk-republish the data.

---

## Running locally

The site uses `fetch()`, so open it through a local web server instead of `file://`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/the-rest-of-us/the-rest-of-us.github.io.git
cd the-rest-of-us.github.io
python3 -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000
```

### Deploying

The site deploys from the `main` branch root. Go to *Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: Deploy from a branch → `main` / `(root)`*. The empty `.nojekyll` file tells GitHub Pages to serve the files as they are.

## Contributing

Issues and PRs are welcome, especially:

- new regional hubs;
- accessibility and internationalisation improvements to the UI;
- proposals for schema changes. Open an issue first, because every hub depends on the schema. Changes that would bring back age proxies (dates, tenure, graduation years) will not be accepted.
